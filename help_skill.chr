Help on skill: Adrenaline rush.
Usage duration: 2.
Mental Cost: 150 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
With this skill, a monk can take advantage of his mastery of his mind to
aid in combat.  By using this skill, the monk summons control of his mental
abilities to force his glands to release a burst of adrenaline, which
rushes through his bloodstream and provides his muscles with extra power
and speed, greatly enhancing his combat abilities.  Unfortunately, this
depletes the muscles'natural ability to cleanse themselves of toxins and
restore fuel, and the result is that after the adrenaline leaves the
monk's bloodstream, he is left weaker and sluggish for a time.

Help on skill: Advanced martial arts.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While even an inexperienced monk may be able to complete a great number of
martial arts techniques competently, there are several that can be mastered
only by someone of advanced training.  These techniques may look overly
flashy and useless in practice to someone who is not familiar with them,
they are in fact just the opposite, highly specialized and necessary
techniques that make a truly experienced monk capable of doing vast
amounts of damage.  This skill describes a monk's total knowledge of
advanced martial arts techniques.

Help on skill: Ambidextrous attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill comes as a necessary part of a monk's training in unarmed
combat.  Nearly all monks naturally favor one leg over the other, and
one arm over the other as well, when it comes to completing martial
arts techniques.  This is clearly dangerous, since it often results in
the monk missing opportunities to strike at his opponent.  To correct
this natural behavior, monks are taught to fight equally well with
both sides of their body, and to ignore their natural preferences,
and then to be able to strike at the opponent as often and well as
possible, taking advantage of all openings in the defense.  This skill
describes that training.

Help on skill: Amras' touch.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: knowledge.
Affecting stat(s): knowledge of the skill.
This skill includes the knowledge required for producing and operating one
of the deadliest poisons in the known realm. The origin of this poison is
unknown, except for the initial copy of the formula, which was discovered
hidden in the ancient temple of Burning Night, some time before the current
counting of years began. The poison itself is composed of herbs of no special
properties, yet the precise dosing of each seems to generate odd powers when
combined properly. Only useful when applied to a large wound, Amras' touch
seems to infect the flesh surrounding the puncture point, widening the area
of flesh rendered useless. This additional damage can easily change a near
fatal wound to a lethal one. Also, experiments conducted on captured traitors
have proven that, in a few cases, this contamination can also lead to severe
illness.

hands, and all too often the less brave spellcasters are nowhere to be

principles of attending wounds without supplies or magic. What you can
do is not much, but sometimes the slightest attendance can make the
difference between life and death. Sometimes its enough to just care
for the wounded, without any actual healing.

Help on skill: Balance momentum.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon whirling mastery.
Excluding creatures of strictly inhuman strength, no one is able to keep a
bludgeon in motion with raw strength alone. Initial strikes can easily be
powered by muscle alone, but in any prolonged fight it is the momentum of
the bludgeon that does most of the work. In order to keep your bludgeon in
constant motion, it is critical to place your blows so that they hit the
armored or otherwise hard bits of your opponent. A blow to the gut can
prove most painful, but it all too often results in the loss of momentum
so that the fighter will have to force the maul to swing again. It is
possible to learn the finer points of whirling your cudgel to a point,
but the rest will come with the knowledge of organs required to balance your
blows so that maximum damage is inflicted with the minimal loss of momentum.
The fighters proficient in this skill and mauling can also estimate the
the amount of momentum their weapons currently have by simply typing: 
'momentum'. Higher skill gives more accurate estimations.

Help on skill: Bash.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str.
A shield-bash, however strong you might be, will probably prove non-
lethal unless the opponent in question is the size of a squirrel, but in
comparison to using your bare fists without any sort of martial arts
training, the weight of the shield can be a good advantage. Also, if
an opponent is prepared against a maneuver with your primary weapon, the
sudden bash from the other side may surprise him, possibly interrupting
his own actions.

Help on skill: Batter.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex.
This skill is designed for warriors who fight with a shield and a bludgeon
combination. With an arming like this is clear that the warrior cannot use
both of his hands in guiding of his weapon therefore a skill that bases
entirely on one handed attack moves was created. The warrior is taught how
to use his weapon to launch powerful attack moves from the safety of his
shield. Without knowledge where to strike the warrior will however always
be incomplete. The perfect executing of this skill requires that the warrior
has also gathered knowledge from a skill called 'combat sense'. It is also
noteworthy that the speed of this skill depends heavily from the size of
the used weapon.

Help on skill: Battle hardness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Neutral.
There is a saying among the humans who soldier for a living;
'A seasoned soldier is a quilt of scars', which describes
the hardness of a creature that has been slashed, stabbed,

they have been hit, and quite often, precisely what caused
the damage.

Help on skill: Battle tactics.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The benefit of rough hand-to-hand training is learning how to anticipate the
movement and thoughts of your opponent. Having the determination and skill to
deliver the fatal blow at the precise moment of your opponent's error can cause
devastating amounts of damage. This, and knowing the value of discipline is
what makes men of arms superior leaders in comparison to the spellcasting
guilds; who, despite their wisdom lack the gift of making quick decisions.

Help on skill: Battlecry.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
The purpose of a battlecry before an onslaught is two-fold. On the one
hand it helps you to raise your morale, while on the other hand it invokes
fear within the ranks of your enemies. Experienced fighters often begin their
combat with a bloodcurdling battlecry if they have the initiative. A well
performed battlecry combined with a bold attack can make anyone it is
targeted at freeze in terror, even if the actual damage done is quite low.
This skill can only be used in the beginning of combat.

Help on skill: Benediction of embedding.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
Benediction of embedding is a delicate prayer, taught only to members
of the clergy. While the reasons for performing vary from one faith to
another, this is a ritual that has but one goal. To harness the dormant
powers of the godly fragments known simply as Shards in a manner that
entwines their power permanently to a piece of armour or a weapon. Once
the Shard has been properly embedded, it will grant to its host item
mystical powers that vary greatly from one Shard to another, due to
multiple forms and sizes the Shards take.
Syntax: Place the item and the Shard you wish to embed on the ground,
        and use this skill with the armour's name as argument. The
        first Shard on the ground will be used.

Help on skill: Berserk.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: Special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
The Fighters' Guild has often suffered from the mockery of the guilds that
consider their techniques more delicate, and not the least because of the
art of berserking. What looks like mad, uncontrolled rage to outsiders, is
actually something you must practice over and over again to successfully
use to your best advantage. A berserking fighter is bolstered in several
ways if he controls it. The fighter's strength, bravery and pain tolerance
raise according to the level of his training, and contrary to what other
guilds like to think, they remain in full control of their actions. The art
of berserking at will is mastered through the ability to control the
body's functions by mere will alone. The origin of this way was lost
in the tides of time, but the native barbarian tribes of the realm are
often assumed to be the likely source. Several other skills are linked
to this technique, and to take full advantage of the barbarian tribes'
heritage, achieving a high level of mastery in all of them is recommended.

Help on skill: Bravery.
Usage duration: Automatic.
Skill type: Special.
A berserking fighter is able to ignore pain and horror of the battle
by becoming so enraged and fierce that any personal loss becomes trivial.
The technique of berserking gives some of these advantages alone, but all
fighters experience a large scale of emotions in any combat. The most
meaningful of those should be mastered with individual and targeted
exercises. Bravery teaches the berserker to control the terror and fear
that much larger or more numerous opponents may inflict upon him.
The conditioning, if properly learnt, is so strong that the berserker
might even be able to resist magical means of frightening him.
Note: Bravery works automatically in conjunction with Berserk.

Help on skill: Brawl.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
This skill is actually a combination of different talents that all
have to do with being proficient in using different weapons of the ancients
weapons class. These weapons can be roughly divided to four subcategories: 
puncturing weapons, bladed weapons, whips and different bludgeons.
This skill teaches its master to effectively use all of these odd weapons
with such deadly force that a skilled brawler is a terror to any opponent.
The damage caused by this skill is based on your weapon, physical statistics
and skill knowledge in brawl and dirty blow.
NOTE: these ancient weapons differ so much from each other that the damage
      caused by them can vary greatly. Whips cause great pain whereas mauls
      tend to cause vast internal damage.

Help on skill: Build body.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
With this skill the death knight can attach the parts of the body into a
form he wants. Different races require different parts for the body, for
example some races need only bones, not the flesh. This skill requires
spell points according to the amount of body parts the knight needs to
attach to each other in order to form the body. The outcome of the succesful
use of this skill is a new body which can be stored in the death room.
The knight gets feedback on how well he made the corpse, 100% is a perfect
body, 0% is a total failure. The affecting stats are skill %, wisdom,.
Skill % of focus death magic and the quality of the bodyparts which are used.

needed for a body of the target race. The syntax is: use build body at
<race name>,<part1>,<part2>,<part n>.

Help on skill: Ca reo.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Ca Reo is the elven word for Absence. Humans often take note of
the seemingly great presence of elves, the way they seem to
'belong' in their environment. This is because an elf experiences
life directly and presently, where humans waste much time worrying
over what has already happened and what is still to come. Because
elves exist so strongly in the present, their absence from other
states is just as great. After harvested to combatative use, this
trait makes the elvenkind profoundly hard to hurt, for not even a
greater god may hit you where you are not. This style of Loc Ecsuram
is complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'ca reo' or 'absence' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.

Help on skill: Calm down.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: Special.
A fighter who enrages himself to the point of berserking can prove to be
a very dangerous foe, not the least because of their near legendary
ability to ignore the pain they have suffered. There is no permanent

of calming down are required for the fighter to choose the moment he

knuckles to aid in combat is the ability to attract a small amount of
this energy into a single point to serve as a light source, which will
follow the monk around.  This is a simple skill for all but the most
inexperienced monks to use, requiring far less energy than that used
to electrify the knuckles, and less mental ability as well.  Despite
that fact, this can be a very useful ability for a monk to have,
should he become lost in the dark and be of a race unable to see in it.

able to consider and place his attacks intelligently instead of simply
bashing when opportunity arises. When performed by a master, this technique

Help on skill: Defend.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: defensive.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
Sometimes when your opponent proves to be extremely fiercesome in
hand-to-hand combat, it is strategically wise to concentrate on
defending yourself and let the other members of your warparty
deal the actual damage. A defending fighter uses his shield to
its full effect, placing it infront of his body and lowering down
to hide as much of himself behind it as possible. This tactic
is very effective against all forms of physical damage that the
shield can stop. The downside however, is that a berserking fighter
will utterly refuse to hide behind any object, and you need a shield
to perform this action. The quality and duration of the defense depends
on your skill percentage.

favored by many of the Fighters' guild. The range of different ancients is
quite wide, even though most agree on the best weapon of that sort.

the blows by playing them less than fairly. Exposed areas with nerve
concentrations, the groin, the eyes and other vulnerable parts of the body
are the common targets of these less than fair attacks. The shock of the
assault can often cause stun in the opponent, and it also augments the
damage inflicted. This skill works in conjunction with Brawl, and the

are unknown to all but the priesthood of the Drow. It is rumored among the
men that the key ingredient, the blood of Llith, is what caused the Elf to
be twisted into drows when the race was born. It is suspected however, that
the essence called the blood of Llith is hardly the actual blood of this
demi-God, but some sort of a herbal substance that stimulates some of the
effects that drows are rumored to suffer from. This poison is especially
easy to spread on a victim, even the slightest hit from a weapon can
infect the target.
Note that certain races seem immune to this sort of poisoning.

spells which, while difficult to truly master, can sometimes provide that
added deftness to a heal which could make all the difference between life
and death.

Help on skill: Flying.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Special.
Those people adept in this skill are better at flying whether they have
wings or fly using a spell. Being better means that you are less likely

Help on skill: Focus ki.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While the Ki skill allows a monk to concentrate his energy on producing
a loud shout combined with a single powerful attack designed to stun an
enemy, knowledge of the technique of Ki alone is often insufficient to
accomplish that goal.  To enhance the Ki skill, and as part of the mastery
of a monk's body, he will learn to focus all of his energy into that shout
and strike, and will greatly increase both the damage done and the intensity
of the stun delivered.

Help on skill: Focus kungfu attacks.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While Kungfu may be considered the pinnacle of the training of a monk's
mastery over his body, a Kungfu which strikes critically at the enemy's
most undefended parts must be considered the pinnacle of its execution.
To accomplish this feat, the monk must be able to focus his entire body
into the execution of the Kungfu attack, relaxing and ignoring all else
for a brief moment.  When this is accomplished, the Kungfu that results
will do significantly more damage to the enemy.  This skill represents
a monk's ability to focus his Kungfu attacks in this manner.

Help on skill: Focus power.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Spell weaver skill.
Affecting stat(s): int.

Help on skill: Forge talisman.
Usage duration: 30.
Skill type: neutral..
Affecting Stat: Skill Percent.
This skill is used to forge a magical Talisman.  Talismans can be
activated by the Awaken Talisman spell.  Once awakened, anyone can
use a Talisman to focus one of their skills or spells, increasing
its effects.  Power and duration depend on the skill with which a
Talisman was forged and awakened.  Note that only the Druid that
Awakens the Talisman can take advantage of its full power.  Other
Druids, and Bards, can take good advantage of the Talisman, with
other guilds being able to take advantage of only some of a Talisman's
power.  Talisman's can NOT be focused on the following skills/spells: 
awaken talisman
forge talisman
leadership
demon and devil lore
battle tactics
balance momentum
damage direction
bargain.

Help on skill: Forgery.
Usage duration: 19.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): wis, int and dex.
This skill is mastered only by the most impressive thieves.
With this skill the experienced thief makes a forged replicant of the target
item. This skill is very much unlike other skills because it uses magical
energy in order to quickly replicate the appearance of the item and to hold
that given item together against the forces of nature that tear it apart.
The item will look and feel exactly the same as the real item but lacks
all it's attributes. These forged copies will _NOT_ save over boots, or be
sold in booths. Selling a forged item as a real one on sales channel is
considered to be sales cheating just like selling an item and then not giving
it. The Gods of the realm are not known to punish this, but if a mortal takes
action towards you because of this, he/she does so with a legimate reason. 

Help on skill: Gem placement.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.

Help on skill: Greater vulnerability.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): wisdom.
Vulnerabilities are a perversion of the elemental shielding magic 
abjurers use actively. They are fundamental when dealing with 
resistant and tough enemies; The realm of Zombiemud is chock full 
of creatures that have developed impressive resistances against 
damage. Fortunately the School of Abjuration is equally impressive 
in their ability to breach these resistances. The vulnerabilities 
are an advanced form of magic that require much time to master, 
but are well worth the time put into them. This skill and the 
spell percents respectively will affect the outcome. 
It is automatically in use.

recognize him.

Help on skill: Hammer.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Bludgeons are weapons that require little knowledge to use for moderate
results, yet those who choose to specialize in armed combat with mauls are
reluctant to say that any-a-man is a professional at birth if he only has
the strength to move a maul. Strength alone helps, but without the proper
techniques anyone would tire quickly in the heat of combat. This skill
covers the most basic of bludgeon techniques, how to hammer your opponents
without tiring yourself the first few seconds.

Help on skill: Healing resonance.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Most magic induced healing within the realm is done by manipulating the
flow of life in and around a being. This manipulation is has been known
to cause strange resonance, much like a musical note, within the very bones
and sinew of those hurt souls, and this fact has not been lost upon the true
healers of the realm. Knowing how to control this reverberation and mold it
into further healing is an art, and only the best healers in the land ever
manage to perfect it, though many try. Oddly enough, it has been noted that
no healer, not even Vorth, has ever managed to control this resonance upon
their own body. Only from one soul to another can the reverberation be even
remotely controlled; never in multiple heals. Even when artful with the skill,
it has been noted that for the most powerful of heal spells, resonance is
nigh impossible to achieve.

Help on skill: Healing trance.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: neutral.
A monk who has trained extensively can combine his masteries over both his
body and mind, and cause himself to relax completely, redirecting all
energy towards the healing of the body and regeneration of mental energy.
While knowledge of this skill is available to all experienced monks,
those who take the time to truly master it through training of 'Mastery
of Healing Trance,' as part of their study of mastery of the mind will
experience noticably better results.  Naturally, it is not possible for
the monk to achieve the concentration necessary for this skill while
fighting.

Help on skill: Hear noises.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: neutral.
It is hardly needed to say that in order to survive a battle you must
possess a clear image of your surroundings and the possible threats.

direction. This skill teaches you not only to let yourself calm down and
listen, but to direct your attention to a specific direction as well..

Help on skill: Hurl axes.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): various.
This powerful attack maneuver is the culmination of ranger's knowledge
in the axe weapons. With this skill, rangers of the deep forest can
hurl their axes at their enemies with lethal force, and actually have
the axes returned to them. This is only possible with the aid of a
magical enchantment, a spell called with the name 'balance axe' by its
inventor - a ranger, who got frustrated on losing his weapons to
enemies who survived his attack and fled with the axes..
The effectivess of this skill depends on the strength, dexterity and
ambidexterity of the ranger, relative size of the target, quality of the
weapons, as well as user's knowledge in axe fighting style, treecutting,
weapon skill, leftwield, axe mastery, spot weakness and bladed fury.

Help on skill: Ignore pain.
Usage duration: Automatic.

in dealing with system shock and calming down come into question. Ignore
pain works in conjunction with Berserk.

Affecting stat(s): dex.

specially summoned objects to entertain and please his

is the ability to dodge several incoming area attacks, or at
least a portion thereof.  Another thing the bard may do is

Help on skill: Ki.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Often it is not wise to start a battle against an opponent who is fully
capable of defending itself.  To give a monk an extra edge against a tough
enemy, he will often start the battle with a single attack combined with
a battle shout.  This has the effect of startling and suprising the enemy,
while at the same time inflicting some damage.  If correctly executed, this
technique will leave the target stunned and unable to fight back, so that
the monk and his party are able to inflict further damage without fear
for their own health.  Also, by continuing his training, a monk who studies
the ability to focus this attack may be able to strike a second blow to the
enemy, dealing more damage and stunning them yet again.

Help on skill: Kick.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Kicking is one of the most basic forms of attack, but that does not
mean it could be performed correctly without any practice. Other guilds,
especially the ones interested in magic, would probably find it amusing
that some spend time practicing how to extend their leg properly.
However, a properly placed kick can actually prove just as nasty as some
of the minor offensive spells. A fighter who wars and lives is a fighter
who knows the value of basic training.

Help on skill: Kick placement.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): dex.

usually start battle with this skill. There are very few opponents

impressive samurais. Using this skill and a sharp katana samurai
can be very dangerous opponent indeed.

Help on skill: Knowledge of omens.

to predict the changes of casting conditions -during- their spellcasting.

Help on skill: Kungfu.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
Monks train in a number of powerful single attacks, which are much stronger
and more deadly than the normal routine of blows delivered in the course of
combat.  The techniques together are called 'Kungfu', and form the most
important part of the combat skills of the monk.  With this skill the monk
is able to make use of all of his amassed knowledge in the field of the
martial arts to strike his opponent.  Because of this nature of Kungfu,
it is necessary to have knowledge in the simpler techniques to be able
to realize the full potential of the skill.  Specifically, knowledge in
'fast blow', 'power kick', and 'mastery of kungfu' will increase the
damage done.  Also, it is known that knowledge of 'focus kungfu attacks'
can allow the monk to strike critically with kungfu, and that knowledge
in the martial arts will increase the damage as well.

Help on skill: Leadership.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Able leadership has always been the key ingredient in the mid of a successful
party. This skill will not only train you how to successfully lead and command

Help on skill: Loc ecsuram.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: Staff combat.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, skill knowledge and magus.
Loc Ecsuram is the elven art of staff combat practiced by the
most skilled of elves from the dawn of the history of the race.
It is a form of combat performed by a single weapon wielded in
both hands, and more a matter of the mind than the body.

The Loc Ecsuram is in many ways closest of all the elvish ways to the
Brotherhood of the Monks. Both rely on unlocking the inner power
of the combatant as well as turning the force of the opponent to
serve against themselves. Both consist of elements more profound
than simple martial arts. Furthermore, just like the art of
Kungfu, Loc Ecsuram can not be wholly learned by training alone.
Only after a life's experience of the Loc can the styles first
learned in the training grounds truly be perfected.

Once in the proper state of mind, the elf armed with a staff,
Loc in their language, will remain constantly alert to dangers,
and react should combat be initiated. This style of combat is as
much part of the elvish way of living for those elves who practice
it as the nature around them. It requires no effort to stay vigilant.

Certain parts of the Loc ecsuram can be performed without an opponent
present. This is because while Loc Ecsuram is a single unified way, it
contains several very different elements. Some, once learned, remain
always effective whenever in the proper state of mind, while others
require conscious effort to perform. This skill teaches its practioner
the basics of combat with a Loc and allows him to use it to adopt the
proper state of mind required for other elements of the Loc Ecsuram.


Help on skill: Lunge.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: Attack.

Help on skill: Magus.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Magus is the elven word for Magic. The force which exists in all
things and beings. Perhaps the most powerful, fundamental force
in the universe, Magus empowers you to overcome your limitations,
drawing upon the power of life.

With this skill an elf trained in the Loc Ecsuram can draw upon
magic, compensating for his physical abilities. The magic will
be woven into every attack he performs, until its power is finally
consumed. This natural way of tapping magical potential truly does
compensate for the lack of physical prowess, at the service of a
true master, it can even replenish vigour and remove fatigue.

The more intelligent and wise the elf, the more power he can
contain at once, and more Magus is conveyed in each transition.
The Magus directed in this manner truly becomes a part of its user,
to the point that those susceptible to it can even see an aura
enveloping him.

Because the nature of Magus is inherently offensive, those who are
trained in the art of offensive magic are far better in this than
other elves. Sorcerers, Mages, Clerics, Psionicists, Warlocks as well
as the Druids of Scathach receive training of this manner. The higher
level in any of these an Elf reaches, the greater the benefit. However,
once having learned the offensive art fully in a guild, levels in a
second guild provide no further addition of power. Not unless the
training in the first guild is still lacking or incomplete.

This style of Loc Ecsuram is complicated and requires specific
concentration. You may do this by typing 'magus' or 'magic' while
focused in Loc Ecsuram to perform the ability, and 'look at yourself'
or 'the aura' at any time to see your current aura of power.
This ability is stackable.

by the monk as 'martial arts'.  This covers all of these, as well as the
more fundamental aspects of fighting with the hands and feet rather than

affect the monk's ability to do damage with his Kungfu attacks.

Help on skill: Master tumbler.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
One skill practiced by many monks is that of tumbling to avoid some spells.
This is accomplished through careful study of the physical paths traveled
by those spells towards the monk, as well as of the movements necessary to
leave that path as quickly as possible.  It is not an easy task to tumble
and avoid an incoming spell, made more difficult by the speed of the spell
and the sometimes unnatural position the monk is left in in the middle of
a fight.  However, those who study exceptionally hard at mastering their
bodies and the techniques of tumbling are known to have a significant
advantage in this act.  This skill describes that advanced knowledge in
the area of tumbling.

with proficiency in the bludgeons weapon class. In order to successfully
mutilate a designated target, you must learn the different bludgeon
techniques that this skill takes advantage of.'Hammer' is the most important
one because all further studies base on the principles of hammering an enemy.

of different techniques come into play. Different techniques fit different
purposes and moments, and therefore it is important to know which technique
to rely on in a given situation. You control your offense by typing the name
of the technique you wish to employ when you are engaged in combat. Should
you not find a suitable opportunity for an advanced technique, or lack
knowledge in them, your attacks will consist of the basic, hammering blows..

Help on skill: Overhead swing.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Often considered mere bashing by the users of more 'civilized' weapons, this
bludgeon technique seems easier to perform than it really is. The ability to
judge the right moment to open up your defense by raising your weapon far
above your head is something that only comes with practice. This form of
an attack is suitable for occasions when the opponent is either just raising
his defenses or is guarding his upper torso badly. Should the powerful bash

Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: defensive.
The master of this skill is able to parry, and thus avoid, hits in combat.
Experienced fighters and paladins are often able to follow up their parry
with a riposte if they so choose. Parrying and dodging are the two most basic
means of avoiding damage in hand-to-hand combat, and most fighter type guilds
are proficient in either one or both of them. Dodge and parry together form
the defensive value that is displayed when you toggle your parry setting.
This value is also affected by the weight you are carrying. It is to be
noted however, that when concentrating on parrying hits, your ability to
perform attacks of your own drops. It is possible to alternate the amount
of concentration towards parrying by typing: 'parry <0-51>'.
this will directly reflect to the values of both your Attack and
Parry skill. Parrying is more efficient with a shield.

Help on skill: Pon arila.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Pon Arila is the elven word for Perception. A profound awareness
of your surroundings and changes. Elendien are by their nature
connected to the world with deeper ties than most other creatures.
Their long life and profound affection for nature causes them
to experience the state of the world in persona. While this ability
is the natural way of any elf, harvesting its power in combat
requires an adjustment in thinking, which this skill represents.
After such an adjustment is made, the trainee becomes aware of his
surroundings to a point nearing precognition of events. The defensive
capabilities this bestows are very significant and numerous. They all
depend on the keen sense of Perception typical to the Elven race, but
differ from one another in implementation. Due to the nature of this
style, it is always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is
performed.

Help on skill: Pon deila.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Pon Deila means Harmony and Continuity in nature in the elven tongue.
In elven staff fighting, it signifies a method of combat taught
to grace the movements of an elf with the rythm of nature. This makes
the transition from one offensive movement to the next faster. Now and
then the true master of this art will also be able to deliver far more
powerful blows with his Loc, as he will move in perfect harmony with
their chosen weapon. Due to the nature of this style, it is always
in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is performed.

Help on skill: Power kick.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
When a young monk is first learning to fight with his hands and feet, it is
natural to learn the simpler, faster blows delivered with the hands first.
However, the monks do not neglect the increased power that can be delivered
using the larger muscles of the legs and stronger surfaces of the feet.  By
taking advantage of this and making a powerful kick at the enemy, even a
young monk is capable of dealing significant damage.

Help on skill: power manipulation

Help on skill: Pra evaleo.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Pra Evaleo is the elven word for Power. The staff fighting style
designed to subdue the opponent was named after it. These attacks
are performed simultaneously with those of Volo but due to the strain
their performance causes, and the opportunities they require to succeed,
appear more infrequently. In the art of Loc Ecsuram, the Volo is used to
injure and distract the opponent until a suitable opportunity presents
itself, which is then pressed with Pra Evaleo. This style of Loc Ecsuram
is complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'pra evaleo' or 'power' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.

Help on skill: Prepare corpse.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and undead surgery.
When an advanced necromancer, one acquainted with the latest developments
in the field of scientific necromancy, wishes to create an undead, this skill
will be necessary. Traditional undead only require a corpse for reanimation,
but undead creatures animated with the scientific method, such as the
Frankenstein, require custom bodyparts. Upon successful use, this skill will
produce enough raw material for the creation of one such bodypart.
The efficiency of this skill is based on knowledge of this skill and
knowledge of the skill 'undead surgery'.

Help on skill: Prev enire.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Prev Enire is the elven word for Reaction. In staff fighting, it
signifies the way of matching the move of your opponent with an
equal one of your own, timed seamlessly to fit that of your foe.
An attack aimed to kill often leaves its performer prone to an
instant counter-attack, because its performer does not expect the
other to be alive to make one. Coupled with Pon Arila this gives
an elf trained with the Loc the means to strike back while bracing
to accept the incoming attack. This style of Loc Ecsuram is
complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'prev enire' or 'reaction' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.

Help on skill: Quick-thrusts.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: Attack.
Quick-thrusts is perhaps one of the fastest lancer skills available to
a skilled polearm fighter, but in the need for speed, it tends to miss
slightly more than other skills as well as doing a bit less damage.
The purpose of the skill is to cause a minor wounds by thrusting your
polearm at your enemy as quickly as possible, thereby opening up the
possibility of scoring hits with more devastating skills.

Help on skill: Rage.
Usage duration: Automatic.
Skill type: Special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
One of the key lessons in berserking is the way a fighter can use his
enraged mood to bolster his physical strength. All anger affects the
body to some extent, yet to fully harvest that advantage in combat and
not waste it by concentrating on the fear for your own life is a skill
of its own. The higher you are skilled in this particular lesson of
of the barbarian art, the more strength you will gain by berserking.

Help on skill: Randomize preference.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int.
For a Spell weaver, this skill is usually the first cross-over
from sheer physical manipulation of the space around him to
actually mastering the arts of creating destruction at will.
Manipulation of the chosen target's very own body by turning
needed saps and blood in to streams of acid and death is an
impressive feat, even if random at first.

Help on skill: Ranged tactics.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Fighting with a shield and a polearm combination is demanding activity due to
the fact that the handling of a long weapon is not easy when your other hand
is tied to a shield and you have to execute the attacks with one hand. Even
a fool can charge into a combat with an armament like this but it is more than
likely that the fool will meet his maker rather swiftly, without the knowledge
of what to do with his weapon. The knowledge in this skill helps the warrior
to use his shield and polearm more efficiently. The warrior will learn how and
where to strike and how to maintain his alertness level through the battle.

Help on skill: Recitation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.

Help on skill: Remove elements.
Usage duration: 15.
Mental Cost: 100 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
When a monk successfully summons the nearby elemental energies and focuses
them into his knuckles, he retains some small amount of control over these
forces.  For this reason, it is a simpler task for the monk to dispel the
elements surrounding his knuckles than it is to summon them in the first
place, taking far less mental energy.  Since the monks are taught from an
early age that these forces are beneficial, and in fact almost necessary,
this skill is most often used so that the monk can call a different
element into his knuckles.

Help on skill: Rend.

its bare claws.

Help on skill: Rescue.
Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
This rather delicate technique is used for fighters with long experience
in fighting together as a group. Before entering a potentially dangerous
fight the leader and the potential rescuer agree on the level of damage
the leader will sustain before the rescuer steps to the front. Then as
the field of battle is reached the change of the person taking the
hits will automatically take place if the need occurs. A pact of rescuing,
once made, lasts until the warparty ends, or the rescuing takes place..
Usage: rescuer: use rescue at <leader>, leader: set wimpy to desired amnt.

conviction that Evil must be destroyed at all costs.

Help on skill: Riposte.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Riposting means performing an immediate counter-attack after a successful
parry. The amount of parried hits depends on your current defence factor
which is modified by many things, such as weight and skill percents.
You are able to riposte as many hits as you manage to parry, and
since some creatures can hit you quite often this can add to a great
amount of damage over time. Due to the quickness of the ripostes the
actual damage of one hit is quite low, although it can be augmented
with the skill Enhanced riposte.

Help on skill: Running red.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: knowledge.
Affecting stat(s): knowledge of the skill.
This skill gifts its learner with the ability to produce and successfully
operate a herbal compound of anti-coagulative properties. This compound

the sick and infected, but was later refined to its current excellence by
John. A wound large enough to cut the bigger veins will bleed for quite
some time if Running Red has been applied properly and enters the targets
system, poisoning the bloodstream for some time.
Knowledge of bloodletting gives a slight bonus to the skill.

Help on skill: Sacrifice of extended life.
Usage duration: 20.

ritualistic altar of death knights. When using this skill the knight
will offer a corpse (the bigger the better) to the god of death and
as reward the knight will gain a greater chance to avoid the clutches
of death the next time they meet. The effectiveness of this skill
depends on the power of the corpse sacrificed, the skill % and the wisdom
of the knight. The blessing will disappear if the knight in question

Help on skill: Smash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
With this powerful skill a cleric may bludgeon a hated enemy to
death with several powerful blows from either a bludgeoning
weapon or a staff.  The damage performed depends on the cleric's
strength and weapon power.  Enraged priests are known to do
a bit more damage with this skill as well.  The true power of
smash, however, lies in the priest's ability to deal multiple
attacks, causing much more damage than normal.  These attacks
have been known to rarely interrupt the target's concentration
or even stun them completely.  The number of extra attacks is
related to the priest's wisdom, weapon skills and the amount
of holy might they can channel, while to the damage of each
extra attack directly relates to the priest's faith.

Help on skill: Spinning patterns.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
This rather odd technique is seldom used in actual combat, but due
to its efficiency in physically straining its user, this technique
is still taught to the initiates of the guild. The principle of
the technique is to accelerate the movement of the bludgeons as
quickly and strongly as possible, ignoring the strain it causes
to the user. The fatigue created in the act of whirling is the
very reason the guild has abandoned it as a useful technique
for gathering momentum.

Help on skill: Spiritism.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
The act of channelling energies through a spirit is far from simple,
and this skill is vital for maximal efficiency when transferring mental
energy to a called spirit. This skill also affects the efficiency of the
actual blast of negative energy from the spirit.

Help on skill: Spiritual link.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
Called spirits are almost incomprehensible creatures even for necromancers,
who are accustomed to dealing with beings originated from the negative energy
plane. Therefore a necromancer will benefit greatly from being more attuned to
the negative energy plane and gains the ability to transmit commands much
faster over the spiritual link to his called spirit.

Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, weapon stats and skill knowledge.
Before a fighter is able to learn the finer points of techniques used in
various offensive maneuvers, it is crucial to learn to pack some force
behind the attacks. Striking is the most basic way of assaulting a target
with a melee-weapon. Since striking is a relatively simple way of attacking
an enemy, it can be easily misjudged as inefficient. This is partially
true, the finer techniques make better use of the special properties of
their own specific weapon types, but they are also limited to those types
of weapons only. Striking works well in conjunction with any weapon type.

Help on skill: Strike mighty blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Named by the previous groups of initiate maulers, this skill orginates from
the vigorous exercises performed in order to augment the momentary strength
of a soldier. The idea of these exercises is to strengthen the fighter so
that he may, when needed to, gather all his strength behind one single maul.
This is a rather desperate tactic, since such a blow usually uses up the
fighter's reserves of power and there is a risk of the maul getting stuck.
Most maulers choose to use it as a last minute option to end a prolonged
fight with one mighty blow from a warhammer.

Help on skill: System shock.
Usage duration: Automatic.
Skill type: Special.
A berserking fighter is able to ignore the pain and damage he suffers
due to his enraged mood, but this advantage is only temporary.
Should the fighter remain alive long enough, the rage will
wear off and the pain will be felt. Highly experienced fighters
are able to ignore amounts of damage sufficient to instantly kill
a lesser person, and therefore it is vital to be able to deal with
the shock that follows calming down. The fighters skilled in system
shock will suffer a smaller portion of the damage ignored, and if
lucky, they can sometimes survive even if the damage felt exceeds
their current stamina.

Help on skill: Tumble.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Of the attack spells currently known to the spellcasting guilds of the realm,
a great number are released from the caster's body and travel in a physical path
towards the intended victim.  When this is true, and depending upon the spell,
it may be possible for someone to tumble and avoid the spell entirely.  This of
course requires extensive training, and even then is a risky thing to rely on,
since these spells are designed to hit the target, not to be avoided.

Skill type: defensive.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
This skill allows you to concentrate upon all attacks of one target and
possibly avoid them for a couple of rounds.

Help on skill: Undead surgery.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and unholy ceremony and size of corpse.
Undead beings, owing to the fact that they are actually dead, do not
regenerate and heal like living beings do. Because of this drawback,
necromancers are forced to resort to other means to keep their minions
in good enough shape to fight. Because magical healing is rather inefficient
and is not really an area where necromancers are very proficient, a more
mundane, but very efficient method of healing has been devised.
This gruesome and disgusting technique is used to sew a damaged undead back
to working shape by using parts from another corpse. However, it is not
possible to repair all of the damage the undead has sustained with this skill.
The size of the used corpse also affects the maximum possible healing done
with this skill.

Help on skill: Unholy ceremony.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
When dealing with advanced concepts of necromancy, such as spiritism and
other unholy rituals, it is extremely important to know how the perform the
ceremonies correctly. Good knowledge of this skill symbolizes greater
understanding of such gruesome rituals and allows better efficiency and
higher power to be attained.

Help on skill: Unholy surgery.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
The art of necromancy is age-old, and has been practised by numerous different
necromancers during the course of history. All that time has certainly not
been wasted, and necromancy is undergoing a strong change at this very moment.
Until recently, necromantic rituals have traditionally been very magical in
their nature. Most commonly, animation of dead corpses with negative energy
channeled directly from its native plane. The newest and most advanced addition
is the so-called scientific necromancy, which aims to produce undead creatures
in a very different manner, with little or no magic involved at all.
This particular skill is used to connect the specially crafted bodyparts of an
undead known as a 'Frankenstein' to each other. This skill also requires
additional connecting material in the form of raw corpses..
Usage: use unholy surgery at <add/remove> <head/lhand/rhand/lleg/rleg>

Help on skill: Upper hand.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: spell weaving skill.

spell weavers to master it's arts due to the otherwise too random nature of
their magic.

Help on skill: Wall of steel.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: defensive.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, masteries and dex.
This skill teaches the warrior a way to use his shield on a skill level from
which untrained people can only dream of. He will be taught how to calculate
the landing areas of melee and missile attacks, and how to block them without
an extra effort, all the way to the point where performing a block turns into
almost instinctual activity. After the training the shield will no longer be
a part of his armament but a part of him, a proverbial steel wall that stands
between him and his foes. It is said that true masters of this skill have dared
to challenge even sorcerers and other magicians of great power, walking out from
those duels with only few fried hair. The success ratio of this skill depends from
user's knowledge of this skill, his shield related fighter masteries and
dexterity.

Help on skill: Vampiric touch.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: Attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and skill percentage.

of his health, which in turn will be given to the undead.

Help on skill: Whirling maces.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
The deadliest of bludgeons cause devastating damage because of several key
factors. Magical properties, crudely placed spikes and raw force all help, but
the most important factor is the momentum of the maul. The greater velocity
the greater damage upon impact. This technique instructs its master to whirl
his maces in the fashion that besides dealing blows, the maces also pick up
speed. The whirling effect however makes this technique quite inaccurate, and
damage caused by it is often random and badly placed even if impressive.

Help on skill: Whirlwind.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: Defensive.
This skill creates a local weather disturbance that can be directed
at one's enemies, forcing them from the current room.

Help on skill: Whirlwind attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Whirlwind attacks are hit combinations that base themselves upon using
the momentum of the wielded weapon. A standard offensive from a fighter
begins with an attack, instantly followed by a doublehit to approximately
the same area, and then the whirlwind attack is executed. This happens
by applying leverage to the weapon, swinging it quickly around, and
striking yet another hit. There are as many techniques to perform
a whirlwind attack as there are warriors proficient in it, but the
quick pull after a hit is the key element. Whirlwind attack can be
successful only after a doublehit, and it is possible to execute it
with either or both hands. Therefore a skilled warrior can hit up to
six times, although some of the Warlords have been seen performing
combinations with even more attacks in them.

Help on skill: Whirlwind slash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: Attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
The skilled fighters and rangers who have chosen blades as their preferred
weapon sometimes execute whirling slashes that wound multiple opponents at
once. The principle of this weapon technique is to engage the intended
targets in melee-combat, drawing them close enough for the blade's reach,
and then launching a series of slashes and cuts at the entire mass of
enemies. Although any given one of the wounds inflicted will most likely
prove far inferior to those a blademaster can inflict with a targeted slash,
with weak or injured enemies this display of swordmanship can take out
several foes at once. This technique is popularly used for executing the
hostile, yet inadept, peasants.

Help on skill: Wild blow.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: Attack.
With this basic polearm fighting skill, the warrior swings his weapon
quickly about himself, attempting to hack and/or pierce his enemy.
The main use of this skill is to setup some of the more intricate hits
that the fighter can accomplish.  Wild blow is known to fail much
more frequently than most other polearm fighting skills, as it relies
more on blind luck than on pure skill.

Help on skill: Wilderness survival.

building.

Help on skill: Will of god.

Help on skill: Willpower.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automagic.
Necromancers are usually physically weak beings, and depend on their mindless
undead minions in fighting battles for them. The method of controlling such
undead requires considerable effort, and this skill represents rigorous
training in such activity. The stronger a necromancer's will is, the less he
will need to exert himself when commanding his minions.

Help on skill: Vocal training.

Affecting stat(s): cha.
This skill is checked every time you sing a song.
This skill will help increase the effectiveness of
your singing.

Help on skill: Volo.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Loc Ecsuram.
Volo is the elven word for Speed. The quick, less powerful staff
fighting technique is understood through this word. Knowledge in
Volo will make the melee attacks that are performed simultaneously
with those of Pra Evaleo more powerful. Even though of low power, these
attacks will injure and distract the opponent until a moment suitable for
the final blow presents itself. The power of these attacks lies in the
physical fighting ability of its user, as well as knowledge in Volo. Like
with any other aspect of the art of staff fighting, the magical aura of
life the elvenkind refer only to as 'Magus', should it be powerful enough,
extends and enhances its user greatly beyond his typical physical fighting
ability. Even a seemingly weak practioner of Loc Ecsuram is to be feared,
should he prove strong in his devotion to this force. Due to the nature
of this style, it is always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is performed.
