Help on spell: Acid arrow.

Maximum damage: 145.
Spell words: yluigh bugh.
This spell is very similiar to the more simple spell named Flame arrow.
The only actual difference between the spell of Acid arrow and that of Flame
arrow is the composition of the arrow itself. To become a good spellcaster, an
apprentice must study atleast the basics of alchemy. The hours of studying
pay off upon mastery oft this spell. When succesfully casting this spell, the
caster summons an arrow made of acid. When the arrow materializes the caster
must blast the arrow immediately at his foe or the arrow loses its efficiency
and swiftness. Research indicates that a person with more wisdom is able
to summon a much more powerful arrow. Also, the intelligence of the caster
makes the arrow more efficient. But still, no one has yet found how to summon
an single arrow devastating to take your opponent down, no matter how strong
it would be.

Help on spell: Call spirit.
Casting time: 20 rounds.
Spell cost: 999 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Spiridam roes spiridam roes.
Conventional undead are usually walking corpses, once dead flesh animated in
a foul imitation of life. A different type of undead is created when the
tortured remains of souls and spirits that still reside in their rotting
caskets are called forth and given form by pure negative energy. Spirits are
not useful in the same sense as the other undead, by not being able to
physically interact with this world. However, when used correctly, they are
extremely deadly. A spirit is able to siphon the warmth of life from a victim
or severely destabilize the very bonds that tie every one of us to this plane.
For the spirit to be able to successfully channel negative energy, the
controlling necromancer must transfer his own mental energy to it. The power
of the spirit depends on spell knowledge and the weight of the corpse.
Also, a necromancer may only have a single spirit at a time.
The commands to use with spirits are: sphit and spdon.

locations, the target experiences the darkness of the environment as a
reduction of colours rather than a change in distance vision. This spell
does not hinder the target if she enters a brightly lit location, for its
true use is to 'see' within the darkness and detecting things within it.

This spell is a lesser invulnerability against acid damage.
The caster channels his or her powers to condense moisture
out of the air and enchant the water, turning it into an
adhesive magical liquid that settles on the target's skin.
This liquid neutralizes any caustic substances connecting

protected, thus leaving him or her vulnerable if an attack is
lucky enough to connect with unprotected tissue.

Spell words: Zechan mool gnaur
Affecting stat(s): level and intelligence and spell knowledge.
While it is possible to command an undead minion to move into a desired
direction with the 'control' spell, it would require unnecessary effort
and strain to command the creature every time. Therefore, it is possible
to forge a more permanent link that simply forces the undead to follow the
caster around blindly. The negative energies surging inside the undead will
cause this spell to fade after a certain amount of time that depends on the
caster's level, intelligence and spell knowledge.

Spell words: Death death death...aragaraum death esheer.
With this spell the death knight can demolish the will to live of
any good monster. The effectiveness of the spell depends on casters int,
wis, spell %, skill % of mastery of death illusions and the total amount
of death points the knight possesses. If the spell is succesful the target
will get very depressed about the state of its life and become much more
willing to die, hence easier to hit with spells and skills. This spell
can't be stacked and the knight has to recover from the previous cast
before he can cast it again. The recovery time depends on the power of
the previous chant of death the knight casted.

Of all the spells that a bard may use to infuse her music,

audience to incredible ferocity and berzerk power.  This song
is actually able to inspire members of the audience into striking
extra times every combat round, causing a huge amount of damage
to one's foes.  It is known that the ability to perform this
song is very draining on the bard; the less people the bard
must influence, the more powerful the effect from this song
will be.  Most bards report that they receive the best effect
while in smaller groups of people.

Spell words: Kaei aradus siirwe.
Using this spell the knight can create a cube of pure chaos energy
which will be impassable from both sides to everyone else but the
knight who can exit it from the inside. This spell has two uses, it
can be used as a refuge place for the knight or it can be used to imprison
creatures inside the cube. The target, if not knight, has a saving throw
according to its intelligence and level. The duration of the cube depends
on wis, spell % and skill % of mastery of death protection. The cube can be
broken at any time by the caster with a command 'break_cube'. Due to
the heavy stress caused by handling large amounts of chaos materia this.
Spell can't be casted all the time. The investigations of chaos materia
suggest that all materia of another type except living or dead tissue
will be destroyed if in contact with the materia when the cube collapses,
hence the cube shouldn't be used as a weapon/armour storage.
Note: certain monsters with special teleportation abilities are known
have escaped the chaos cubes.
Additional note: Very large monsters are almost immune to cubing.

of the good aligned monsters near the knight, causing continuous.
Damage. The orb will follow its creator everywhere and drain the
creators spell points in order to maintain itself. The knight can
banish the orb at any time with 'banish_orb'
Note: Due to the chaotic nature of this spell the orb will explode
violently if it becomes in contact with another chaos orb causing
great damage to its surroundings. The damage caused by the orb is
determined by casters intelligence, wisdom and level. It is also
rumoured that members of the high council are favoured by the
gods with extra damage.

can also be destroyed by a certain amount of any damagetype. Those who
don't see the actual nature of the chaos wall only see a dead end where

Spell words: Undeadis meerk follo.
This spell is one of the most sophisticated ones of the death magic.
It will allow the knight to charm other undeads to serve and follow
him. Controlling undeads drains magical energy all the time though
so it's not wise to keep many undeads at once. If the knight runs
out of magical energy the undeads will become mindless creatures again
and attack the knight. The spellcost of this spell is highly dependant
on wis and the skill % of focus death magic.

in order to maintain itself every time the target inside the circle
takes damage. The circle will disappear if the target dies, leaves the

Generally, most of the undead plaguing our world are almost mindless,
little more than mere automatons. However, a skilled necromancer can
project his considerable willpower and force an undead being to perform
simple tasks for him, such as movement, fighting and basic item manipulation.
The undead creature is unaware of being commanded, as the unholy essence
guiding it is simply overridden by the sheer power of the necromancer's mind.
A strong link between the necromancer and his minion is required, effectively
rendering this spell only useful on undead beings the caster has himself animated.

Help on spell: Draining mine.
Casting time: 5 rounds.
Spell cost: 35 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Driel amuras drakka.
This spell will summon a highly unstabile and partly organic concentration
of chaos magic which will slowly drain magical and physical energy from
living creatures around it. When the mine reaches it maximum draining
capacity it will self-destruct and move all the energy it has accumulated
to the knight, if the knight is still in the realm. This spell is best
used as a last resort, since it is not very powerful and it takes a long
time for the mine to charge up and release the energy. The wisdom and spell
percent affect the speed of the draining. The amount the mine can drain
before it comes too unstable to stay in this realm is dependant on the
knights wis, spell % and mastery of draining.
Note: if the knight isn't in the realm when the mine discharges he
wont gain any energy. The mine can't be seen by anyone except the
servants of death, i.e death knights and necromancers, who are also
immune to draining affects of the mines. Not more than one of these
mines can be placed in a room and not more than one casted by the same
knight can exist simultaneously. The mine will self-destruct if attacked
by someone, it can be attacked by anyone even if not seen.

Casting time: 3 rounds.

Spell type: attack.
Damage type: physical.
Maximum damage: 291.
Spell words: ex morituri
Affecting stat(s): spell percent and wisdom.
With the extensive knowledge of what makes up an entity
comes the knowledge of where the greatest flaws in its design
exist. Abjurers' of ages past have used this knowledge to inform
their companions of the weaknesses in their mutual opponents, as well
as to cast the spells of vulnerability. This knowledge can also be used
more directly, to cause direct injury upon an opponent, and due to the
implementation of sophisticated knowledge of the elemental and magical lores,
this injury will be the type the target is the least resistant to. Eventough
useful for when no suitable company is around, this spell is rather inefficient
and weak in comparison to the spells more adept guilds are able to conjure. This
is due to the fact that abjurers' research never aimed for results such as this.
It came to being from necessity alone.

Spell cost: 400 SPs.
Spell type: attack.
Damage type: physical.
Spell words: nequam victus confundo mentis.
Abjuration has come a long way since the first days of trial
and error with vulnerability magic. Research has yielded
a potentially more efficient way to use time and mana to
weaken a foe. Created by the elite of the Abjurers, this
spell involves manipulating the essence in a living being. At
first painstaking experiments in this form of magic were an
utter failure, but through a significant breakthrough in
sorcery brought about by the second coming of the Sorcerers,
a series of successful invocations were made. With this spell,
the abjurer uses runic magic to disturb the elements of the
victim, causing increased susceptability against electric,
magical, fire, physical and asphyxiating attacks.

carries an enchantment meant to enhance the efficiency of one's
respiration. The enchantment is so strong it lessens the damage
taken from asphyxia. There is a slight drawback to this however;
it seems that the magic also slows down the metabolic rate of the
enchanted person, causing him or her to heal slower.

the recipient and densifies the energy to form a force in the
shape of a hauberk. This hauberk will provide protection in melee
against physical harm. Energy hauberk requires more mana than
similar spells a lot simpler in their design, but on the other
hand it lasts longer granting more powerful protection.

Help on spell: Enlarge spirit.
Casting time: 10 rounds.
Spell cost: 666 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Spiridam nelar.
Spirits can be thought of as vessels of pure negative energy.
The amount of energy a single spirit can channel depends on its size,
and sometimes a necromancer wishes to increase the capacity of his spirit
instead of calling a new one in order to avoid the exhausting and terrifying
planar journey. For this purpose, this spell allows a necromancer to increase
the amount of negative energy a spirit can absorb by fusing it with the spirits
of fresh corpses. The amount how much the spirit is enlarged is highly dependent
on spell knowledge and naturally, how powerful the used corpse is.

Casting time: 4 rounds.
Spell cost: 255 SPs.
Spell type: area attack.
Damage type: fire.
Maximum damage: 400.
Spell words: hto freaer.
This spell is very similiar to the much more simple and basic spell called
Firebolt. While studying the spell of Firebolt, the Elder Mages contrived a
way to use the magics at play to create a ball of fire, that would if properly
conjured, explode, causing damage to everyone within its vicinity. The size
of the ball depends on how well the caster has studied this spell. The
caster's intelligence affects how much heat the caster can focus into the ball.
Naturally the bigger and more scalding the ball is, the more damage it deals.
Once the fireball reaches its destination, it explodes wildly, damaging every
foe near it.

Help on spell: Firebolt.
Casting time: 2 rounds.
Spell cost: 204 SPs.
Spell type: attack.
Damage type: fire.
Maximum damage: 300.
Spell words: khar tra erfi.
With this spell, the spellcasting Mage is able to focus the heat within his
body into one isolated spot. This method is very similiar to that of Flame
arrow, but there is ample difference between these spells. Instead of creating
an arrow, the more experienced spellcaster summons a bolt far superior to the
Flame arrow. The bolt does a lot more damage due to its size and higher core
temperature. The elder spellcasters announce that the wisdom of basic natural
elements and caster's intelligence has a noticable effect on the devastating
results the firebolt can create. The mages who developed this spell were
originally trying to create a more efficient  Flame arrow, but for some reason,
the greater fire only manifested itself in the shape of a bolt.

A good spellcaster always knows how to handle the four basic elements: air,
water, fire and earth. In this spell the spellcaster has to know the basics
of the element of fire. By concentrating the body heat the caster can create
an incredibly hot projectile of fire. The projectile itself is way too hot
to touch, the caster has to send it at his foe with using power of will. The
knowledge of this spell offers the caster a chance to create quicker and more
scalding projectiles. This projectile is too weak to burst the target in to
flames.

Help on spell: Flash of power.
Casting time:  10 rounds.
Spell cost:    2040 SPs.
Spell type:    attack.
Damage type:   physical.
Spell words:   Magica fulminatus!
The high mages of old have long known the existance of Shards. Likewise,
they are aware of the Shards' tendency to appear where a great power leaves
this plane of existance. According to the bibliographical information
gathered by Cemreet from the last hundred and fifty years, the chance of
discovering a Shard of the Gods is much greater when the magical items of
the deceased have been destroyed before its own death.
The precise reason for this is unknown, but the Council of the Mage Guild
speculates that the deconstruction of powerful magical equipment releases
awesome amounts of magical energy. This energy then attracts more power to
the site of combat.
Flash of Power is relatively crude spell designed to boost this effect. The
combined power of three mages is used to overload the magical equipment
carried by a creature, thereby destroying the items, but greatly increasing
the chance and possibly the power of an appearing Shard.

be broken. The damage this spell does to the target and the amount of
lifeforce the knight will gain depends on the spell %, mastery of draining %,
intelligence and amount of death points the knight possesses.

Affecting stat(s): int, level and spell percent.
The story behind the creation of this spell tells of a promising young
mage named Mandok, who tried to shortcut his way to perfecting his magic.
While working on the element of fire, he apprenticed for the greatest
master of the element, Gendaran himself. During his training, he accidently
stumbled upon the very essence of fire, and seeing the opportunity to become
more powerful than his master, he stole it and escaped. Knowing that the
essence would be too much for a mere mortal and that it would eventually
corrupt Mandok, Gendaran allowed him to leave. What Mandok didn't expect
is to be hunted by the mage guild, who punished him by taking the essence.
Mandok had already been corrupted, and his spirit could no longer be saved.
The fire essence now resides within the safe keep of the guild, and every
member who has proven her power and loyalty can call upon the essence.
The spell summons whirling magical energies to a location pointed out by
the caster, which turn the air into blazing whips of fire. The flames
consume everything in their path, burning flesh to charred pieces of meat
and boiling the blood out of victims, and even vaporizing bones. Though
the spell's power derives from the usage of the essence itself, it takes
time and practice for highly skilled mages to perfect this spell's
power and learn to manipulate the magical essence in a way, that it grants
protection to the comrades of the caster from the wicked hellish flames.

certain race.  In addition, this knowledge grants the

An old legend tells that the first mage guild leader had horrible breath.
One of the mage's apprentices - a bright young student wanted to play a prank
on his friend and curse her temporarily with exceptionally bad breath just
like the teacher had. The spell somehow went all wrong, and the student
ended up killing half her class. Eventually, the expelled student studied
the area of the spell and managed to refine it to be suited for combat.
As a war began ravaging the nearby lands, the student, seeing an opportunity
was accepted back to the guild, as the spell proved itself by being put
into very effective use.

elements of his breath much like the assassins do with herbs and alchemy.

with death. The cloud is big enough to affect a reasonable area - a room
for example - and everyone in it. The caster's companions will not be

Maximum damage: 145.
Spell words: frtizvg.
When mages first started exploring chaotic elements, they experienced a lot of
troubles and complications. The first and the most difficult problem was how
to bind elements of extremely unstable matter. The mages tried everything
but with very frail results. Yet at last they succesfully bound the chaos
materia in an abrupt arrow shaped missile which travels with extreme speeds
to the target. There is a lot still to be investigated in this spell but
for now the mages have officially started using this spell for their combat
needs. Because the chaos materia is very combustible the spell does not inflict
as much damage as some other spells do. A person of higher intelligence can
bind more pure energy in one missile than a person with lower intelligence.
The knowledge of the Magic missile will surely aid you to deal more effecient.

Help on spell: Meteor blast.
Casting time: 3 rounds.
Spell cost: 357 SPs.
Spell type: attack.

Maximum damage: 202.
Spell words: drazh bragh.
To successfully control a meteor, the spellcaster must have passed a lot of
training and tests. Not even the most experienced of Mages has yet discovered
how to fully control a meteor, and therefore the damage this spell can inflict
is uncertain until such a discovery can be made. The caster's intelligence plays
a major role in this spell, because controlling a meteor is so demanding mentally
and physically. The knowledge in this spell seems to have an effect on the size
of the meteor, and therefore to the amount of potential damage inflicted. The
meteors summoned are still too small to create full devastation. The spell of
Meteor blast and Meteor storm were originally invented when a once great Mage,
his name now forgotten, used this spell as a basis in an attempt to summon
several meteors. He was successful in this act, but discovered to his
disappointment that as the amount of meteors grew, the likelyhood of a direct
hit lessened. This is why this still spell is still in use, to target individual
creatures, instead of areas. Due to the nature of this spell, it has to be cast
outside.

of meteors. It is less well known however, that the intelligence of the casting
Mage affects also. After the meteors hit the ground, a wave of boiling heat
washes over your enemies leaving them with serious burns. This spell still has
one major disadvantage, it requires you to be outdoors when casting this spell.

Help on spell: Raise dead.
Casting time: 10 rounds.
Spell cost: 876 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Gnaaahss raaag wwwar.
Usually, undead are rather stupid and unable to learn anything from their
experiences, but there is an exception. Necromancers are able to entrap
wandering souls into a corpse, creating a dark servant. These servants are
intelligent and versatile, and will serve their masters well, being actually
able to specialize in a player guild and use corresponding skills and spells.
There is a drawback, though, as the servant will be like a newborn when it is
first summoned, and to advance, it will leech experience from its master, much
like a party member would in a party. This experience will be saved over reboots
and 'reincarnations' of the servant, if it is raised again to a different guild.
All in all, it behaves much like a player would. The servant cannot wear
equipment, save for weapons, and its statistics will depend on the equipment
its summoner is wearing during casting. The servant's power and development
is relative to its master's status in necromancy.
Syntax: 'cast raise dead at <corpse> make <guild>' for making a new servant.
           'cast raise dead at <corpse>' for restoring current servant.

multiple natural resistances of a creature with one
concentrated ray of energy. At first this evocation was
kept a secret and tested for anomalies, but as time went by
a risk of potential abuse gave rise, and a decision to
unveil the details of the spell was made. With this spell

with a target will severly decrease his or her resistances
against cold, corrosive substances, psionic damage, poisons
and physical damage.

Spell words: schg trhu bdyr.
In the Guild of Mages, the spell of shocking grasp is one of the first
offensive spells taught to the initiates. With this spell the caster creates
a surge of energy from within his body, which he directs at the enemy. This.
Spell does not require a lot of studying to master, but some base intellect
is needed. It is also said that dexterity has a subtle affect on this spell,
because in order to get a handgrip on the opponent, you need to have some
sort of agility and deftness. The electric surge which the caster creates
can at times be so substantial that the victim can even be stunned by the
surge going through the body. This spell is only intended for foes of
relatively small size, and creatures of any personal power appear to be
immune to the stunning effect.

Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Shiand drygh aurn.
When the reanimation of a truly great and deadly undead is desired,
the tedious process of merging myriad corpses together can rather quickly
become a real problem. This spell is a much more advanced version of the.
Spell 'soul merge', and is capable of simultaneously fusing every suitable
corpse in the room into one. The efficiency of this spell is affected to a
great degree by spell knowledge and also the knowledge of the lesser spell
'soul merge'. This spell requires no target to cast.

Help on spell: Soul merge.
Casting time: 5 rounds.
Spell cost: 50 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Shiand aurn.
Obviously, a single corpse often does not contain enough power to create
a truly powerful and fearsome undead creature. This spell alleviates this
problem, by enabling the very flesh and spiritual residue in two corpses to
be merged, with slight losses. This spell can be recast an unlimited number
of times, each time adding the essence of two corpses together and making it
heavier and thus more powerful. The power that is lost in the merging process
is highly dependent on the caster's spell knowledge. Enchanted corpses cannot
be merged.
Usage: cast soul merge at corpse <x> and corpse <y>

target moves too far from the knight for the knight to be able to
maintain the bond, the knight moves or the bond runs out of power. The.
